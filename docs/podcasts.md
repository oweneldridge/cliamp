# Podcasts

The **Podcasts** provider is always available. No `enabled` setting, API key,
or account is required. Press `Shift+O` (`O`) in the player to open it, or start
directly from the CLI:

```sh
cliamp --provider podcast
```

To open it by default, set the top-level `provider = "podcast"` in
`config.toml`.

## Discover Shows

- **Top Shows (US)** lists Apple's top 100 chart in ranking order, omitting duplicate feeds and shows Apple cannot resolve to a feed.
- In the main Podcasts provider list, press `/`, type a show name, and press `Enter` to search Apple for up to 100 shows. Typing alone does not send search requests. `Esc` clears the search and restores discovery and subscriptions.
- Open **Browse Categories**, then choose a **Genre**, then a **Show**. The 19 categories use Apple's genre-name search, not genre charts. Inside these lists, `/` filters the visible entries.

Press `a` on a show in the provider list to append every episode, or `l` to
append only its newest episode and add it to the end of the queue. Both leave the playlist and the
queue intact, which is what separates them from `Enter`.

Press `Enter` on a show in the provider list or category browser to replace the
main playlist with its episodes, without starting playback. Then select an
episode and press `Enter` to play, or `a` to toggle its play-next queue entry.
`Esc` or `b` returns from the playlist to the provider list.

Feeds load the first 300 playable episodes in feed order. Episode titles, show
names, durations, artwork, and episode numbers are retained when available.
Items without playable audio are skipped.

`Ctrl+R` reloads a show opened from the provider list or category browser. In
the provider list with no show open, it refreshes the top chart. Reopen a show
from `Ctrl+F` results to fetch that feed again without replacing a mixed queue.

## Search Overlay

With Podcasts active, `Ctrl+F` searches for shows as collections, not individual
episodes. Type a query and press `Enter`; this overlay shows up to 20 results.
Its actions differ from opening a show in the main provider list:

| Key | Action on a show result |
| --- | --- |
| `Enter` | Append the feed's episodes to the playlist and start its first episode |
| `a` | Append the feed's episodes; start its first episode if the playlist was empty or nothing is playing |
| `q` | Append the feed's episodes and queue them in feed order, after any already queued tracks; start queued playback if nothing is playing |
| `f` | Subscribe or unsubscribe |
| `Esc` | Return to the search input; press again to close |

## Listening Position

Each episode's position is stored in `podcast_progress.json` in the
[config directory](configuration.md#config-directory). Playing an episode again
resumes five seconds before where you stopped, unless you stopped inside the
first fifteen seconds, in which case it starts over. Finishing one, or stopping
within its last minute, marks it played, shown as a tick in the track list;
an episode shorter than two minutes counts as played past its midpoint
instead. Playing a played episode again clears the mark.

Each episode has one record, keyed by its feed and GUID; a feed that gives an
episode no GUID gets its audio URL in that place, as the feed reader does, and
the show and title carry its record across a rewrite of that URL, unless the
two publication dates differ, which marks a second episode with the same title;
a date missing on either side does not count against the match. Playlists saved
by this version keep both, so their tracks are recognized directly. A track
that arrives without a feed, from a playlist saved by an older version or from
any other source, is matched by show and episode title instead, and only when
the store already holds an episode under that title. An enclosure URL alone
cannot stand in for the metadata: podcast CDNs rewrite those per request, so
the same episode arrives under a different address every time. A title that two
episodes of one show share identifies neither, and a radio stream or a library
track is never mistaken for an episode.

If the file cannot be read at startup, or was written by a newer cliamp,
cliamp leaves it untouched and does not save positions for that session; the
reason is in the log.

## Subscribed Shows Overlay

Press `F` to list your subscriptions. The list comes from the local store, so
it opens without a network call and works for shows Apple's directory does not
carry.

Every action appends rather than replacing, which is the difference that
matters: `Enter` on a show in the provider list calls a playlist replace and
drops the queue, while this overlay adds to what you already have.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Filter by title or author |
| `Enter` | Append the episodes and play the first appended |
| `a` | Append the episodes without disturbing playback |
| `q` | Append the episodes and queue them in feed order |
| `l` | Append the newest episode and add it to the end of the queue |
| `L` | Append the newest episode of every subscribed show |

`l` and `L` pick the newest episode by `podcast.published` when a feed supplies
dates, falling back to feed order.

`Esc` closes the overlay. When it added tracks and you opened it from the
provider list, focus moves to the playlist, on the first track it added, so
`Enter` plays an episode rather than opening the provider row under the cursor.

## Subscriptions

Press `f` on a show in the provider list, category show list, or `Ctrl+F` results
to subscribe or unsubscribe. Subscribed shows appear under **Subscriptions**
and are marked `[subscribed]` in the provider list. On an episode in the main
playlist, `f` still toggles a bookmark, not a subscription.

Subscriptions are saved atomically in `podcast_subscriptions.json` in the
[config directory](configuration.md#config-directory), normally
`~/.config/cliamp/podcast_subscriptions.json`. They remain available when Apple's
directory is offline, but fetching feeds and playing episodes still requires
access to the publisher. This provider has no offline episode download cache.

## Publisher RSS URLs

In the main Podcasts `/` search, type a publisher's RSS URL and press `Enter`.
cliamp fetches the feed directly without searching Apple, including URLs with
no `.xml` or `.rss` extension. A feed becomes a show result only if it contains
at least one playable episode. Press `f` to subscribe, or `Enter` to load it.

Existing RSS URL playback from the CLI or the `u` URL prompt still works:

```sh
cliamp https://example.com/podcast/feed.xml
```

See [Streaming](streaming.md#podcasts) and
[RSS feed playlists](playlists.md#podcast--rss-feed-playlists).

## Seeking and Episode Length

Episodes are finite files, so cliamp plays them through its buffered pipeline
and seeks inside them with the usual keys. The decision comes from the HTTP
response, not the URL: a source with a finite `Content-Length` and no ICY
headers is an episode, while a live station has neither.

The feed's `itunes:duration` is used until the download completes, then the
real length is measured from the file. Publishers routinely understate it,
because the tag describes the master and the file served carries inserted
advertising on top. Measuring keeps the seek bar and the end of the track
honest.

Both depend on `ffmpeg`: the buffered pipeline decodes through it, and the
length is read with `ffprobe`. Without it, episodes play on the live path,
unseekable, with the feed's duration. If the probe fails, the feed's duration
stays. An enclosure served without a `Content-Length`, or with ICY headers, is
treated as a live stream.

## Chart Country

Optionally select another country's top chart in `config.toml`:

```toml
[podcast]
country = "no"
```

`country` is a two-letter country code, defaulting to `"us"`. cliamp does not
detect your location. It affects charts only, not show searches, categories,
subscriptions, or publisher feeds.
